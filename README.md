# 💌 Send to Hydrus
Share files and URLs on Android into Hydrus Client API

## 🛠️ Setup
  - Download [HTTP Shortcuts](https://http-shortcuts.rmy.ch/)
  - Under "Import / Export", choose "Import from URL", enter<br>`https://github.com/Wyrrrd/send-to-hydrus/releases/latest/download/shortcuts.zip`
  - Set variable `hydrus_url` to your Hydrus Client API URL
  - Perform request or set variable `hydrus_api_key` to your API key (needs file and URL permissions)

## ⬆️️ Upgrade
If you are using the older, URL-only version, your API key will not have the file permission. To fix this, remove the API key in Hydrus and then create or request a new one.

## 🤲 Usage

### Easy way (this is what you are here for)
  - Share the URL from whatever menu you normally use, as if you would send it to a friend.
  - Choose "HTTP Shortcuts" from the apps list.
  - ...
  - Profit (?)
  
### Complicated way
  - Open HTTP Shortcuts
  - Press "Send URL" / "Send file"
  - Copy and Paste URL / Choose file to send
  - Press "OK"
